    <h2>History of coffee</h2>
    <img class="clip-path" src="cafeinn_pics/Coffee-clip.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="250">
    <p class="text">The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century, and possibly earlier with a number of reports and legends surrounding its first use. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the early 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen,[1] spreading soon to Mecca and Medina. By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey, the India, and northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe, as well as Southeast Asia and despite the bans imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders in Mecca and Cairo, and later by the Catholic Church</p>
    <p class="text">The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie,[2] borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, in turn borrowed from the Arabic qahwah (قهوة).[3]

        The Arabic word qahwah originally referred to a type of wine, whose etymology is given by Arab lexicographers as deriving from the verb qahā (قها, "to lack hunger") in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant.[3][4] The word qahwah is sometimes alternatively traced to the Arabic quwwa ("power, energy"), or to Kaffa, a medieval kingdom in Ethiopia whence the plant was exported to Arabia.[3][5] These etymologies for qahwah have all been disputed, however. The name qahwah is not used for the berry or plant (the products of the region), which are known in Arabic as bunn and in Somali and Oromo as būn. Semitic languages had the root qhh, "dark color", which became a natural designation for the beverage. According to this analysis, the feminine form qahwah (also meaning "dark in color, dull(ing), dry, sour") was likely chosen to parallel the feminine khamr (خمر, "wine"), and originally meant "the dark one"</p>

    <h2>Spill the Beans</h2>
    <img class="pic" src="cafeinn_pics/coffeebeans.jpg" alt="">
    <p>There are four primary types of coffee beans we’ll be discussing here: Arabica (Coffee arabica), Robusta (Coffee caniphora), Liberica (Coffee liberica), and Excelsa (Coffee liberica var. dewevrei). Let’s discover what differences define these various types of coffee.

        <h3> Arabica </h3>
        As mentioned earlier, Arabica is the most common (and certainly most heavily marketed) type of coffee in North America. That’s because it actually has a sweeter, more delicate flavor and the coffee itself tends to be less acidic. Arabica beans are farmed in areas with high elevations above sea level, particularly those where rain is plentiful. In fact, Brazil, known for its lush rainforest, is the world’s foremost exporter of Arabica beans. The plants themselves are fairly delicate, requiring a fair amount of pruning and constant attention to environmental factors. The Coffee arabica species is particularly prone to disease so farming in great quantities is a challenge. This drives up the cost of the bean considerably in the global market, but many coffee drinkers around the world are happy to pay the difference because of the softer, sweeter taste.
        
        One point to note about the popular but sensitive bean is that its taste has a reputation of being diminished a bit when it is served cold or blended with milk or creamer. While that may be the case, it’s fair to say the difference probably won’t be noticeable when you’re adding some additional flavor to the drink anyway.
        
        <h3>Robusta</h3>
        When it comes to global production, Robusta coffee beans are second on the list and the most popular in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Its name does this bean justice, as it is known for its strong and often harsh flavor profile. Robusta coffees have extremely high levels of caffeine, which makes the plant far more resilient than the Arabica species. That’s because the caffeine acts as natural insect repellent, eliminating a major threat to the tree. The coffee caniphora species is also particularly tolerant of its environment, so it can be grown in any number of altitudes and climates. Because of its reputation for tasting burnt or rubbery, robusta is not generally a very popular coffee commodity, except where very strong coffee is a cultural norm. However, because it’s so much easier to grow and harvest than Arabica beans, many farmers do tend to reap higher profits when they can sell Robusta. So where is it going? Robusta might be used for discount lines like instant coffees and is sometimes used as a filler in dark roasts. By using 3 parts Arabica to 1 part Robusta in a given batch, a roaster might save up to 20% on the cost of raw beans. However, if this looks to you like sacrificing product quality for the bottom line, you’d be right.
        
        There are some instances, though, of delicious, hiqh quality Robusta coffees finding their way onto grocery store shelves. These are generally single-origin coffees made from craft, small-batch roasters. The very best Robusta coffee beans will have hints of chocolate and rum within their flavor profile, but in all reality, are not always readily available. At the end of the day, if your main interest in a cup of coffee is getting a daily dose of caffeine, you’d probably do just as well going with a standard cup of Robusta and cutting the flavor with cream and sugar.
        
        <h3>Liberica</h3>
        Liberica coffee beans are a rare treat. They’re grown in very specific climates with production being far too scarce for farmers to scale their operations to truly satisfy a global marketplace. Even still, the beans are considered a pleasant surprise. Many who’ve tried the coffee liken the aroma to fruit and flowers and describe the flavor as having a somewhat “woody” taste.
        
        There was a time when Liberica coffee was incredibly popular. Near the end of the nineteenth century, a plant disease now known as “coffee rust” had set in and eliminated almost all of the Arabica plants across the entire planet. Because coffee was such a huge commodity, even at that point, farmers and government bodies both set out to find suitable substitutes. The Philippines were the first to harvest and sell the Liberica plant at a noteworthy volume and as the sole supplier the nation saw its economy grow tremendously. At this point, the Philippines was a U.S. territory but as its economy grew the nation declared its independence. As a result, the U.S. imposed steep economic sanctions and cut off supplies to the country. This ultimately led to the downfall of the Liberica coffee bean in the global marketplace, as no other nations were ever able to step up and match the production that the Philippines had once pioneered.
        
        <h3>Excelsa</h3>
        The final type of coffee bean we introduce today is Excelsa. Excelsa is technically a member of the Liberica family, but its species is actually incredibly distinct. Like the Liberica coffee described above, Excelsa is grown primarily in Southeast Asia and represents only a small fraction of the world’s coffee production. Excelsa does boast a tart, fruitier flavor and is known for showing attributes of both light and dark roast coffees to create a unique profile that is frequently sought out by coffee enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Types of coffee</h2>
<img class="pic" src="cafeinn_pics/Coffeemenu.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="650">
<p class="text">Latte, americano, affogato…it’s crazy all that you can do with a few small beans. Whether you’re a coffee newbie or you consider yourself a coffee connoisseur, there are so many types of coffee drinks to discover. Here are some of the most popular types ordered by coffee lovers nationwide.

    <h3>Black</h3>
    Black coffee is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped in hot water, served warm. And if you want to sound fancy, you can call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir.
    
    <h3>Latte</h3>
    As the most popular coffee drink out there, the latte is comprised of a shot of espresso and steamed milk with just a touch of foam. It can be ordered plain or with a flavor shot of anything from vanilla to pumpkin spice. (Here’s how to make a copycat Starbucks pumpkin spice latte.)
    
    <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
    Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.
    
    <h3>Americano</h3>
    With a similar flavor to black coffee, the americano consists of an espresso shot diluted in hot water. Pro tip: if you’re making your own, pour the espresso first, then add the hot water.
    
    <h3>Espresso</h3>
    An espresso shot can be served solo or used as the foundation of most coffee drinks, like lattes and macchiatos.
    
    <h3>Doppio</h3>
    A double shot of espresso, the doppio is perfect for putting extra pep in your step.
    
   <h3> Cortado</h3>
    Like yin and yang, a cortado is the perfect balance of espresso and warm steamed milk. The milk is used to cut back on the espresso’s acidity.
    
    <h3>Red Eye</h3>
    Named after those pesky midnight flights, a red eye can cure any tiresome morning. A full cup of hot coffee with an espresso shot mixed in, this will definitely get your heart racing.
    
    <h3>Galão</h3>
    Originating in Portugal, this hot coffee drink is closely related to the latte and cappuccino. Only difference is it contains about twice as much foamed milk, making it a lighter drink compared to the other two.
    
    <h3>Lungo</h3>
    A lungo is a long-pull espresso. The longer the pull, the more caffeine there is and the more ounces you can enjoy.
    
    <h3>Macchiato</h3>
    The macchiato is another espresso-based drink that has a small amount of foam on top. It’s the happy medium between a cappuccino and a doppio.
    
    <h3>Mocha</h3>
    For all you chocolate lovers out there, you’ll fall in love with a mocha (or maybe you already have). The mocha is a chocolate espresso drink with steamed milk and foam.
    
    <h3>Ristretto</h3>
    Ristretto is an espresso shot. It uses less hot water which creates a sweeter flavor compared to the bitter taste of a traditional shot of espresso or a doppio.
    
    <h3>Flat White</h3>
    This Aussie-born drink is basically a cappuccino without the foam or chocolate sprinkle. It’s an espresso drink with steamed milk.
    
    <h3>Affogato</h3>
    The affogato is an excuse to enjoy a scoop of ice cream any time of day (and any time of year in my opinion). Served with a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso, or two. The affogato is extra delish served over a brownie.
    
    <h3>Café au Lait</h3>
    Café au lait is perfect for the coffee minimalist who wants a bit more flavor. Just add a splash of warm milk to your coffee and you’re all set!
    
    <h3>Irish</h3>
    Irish coffee consists of black coffee, whiskey and sugar, topped with whipped cream. Here’s an Irish coffee recipe that will warm you right up.</p>
